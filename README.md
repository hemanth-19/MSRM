# MSRM
Multilingual Speech Recognition Model (MSRM) is an end-to-end AI system that transcribes, translates, and intelligently answers queries from multilingual audio inputs. Built using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper ASR for speech-to-text transcription, the system detects the spoken language with langdetect, translates it to English via the Google Translate API, and then uses a Hugging Face Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to generate context-aware responses. This pipeline enables seamless voice-based interaction across languages, making it ideal for global communication, customer support, and assistive technologies.
